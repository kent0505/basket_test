        'Team USA goes undefeated in pool play after overpowering Puerto Rico',
    body:
        'The USA Men’s National Basketball Team finished off its group stage play at the Paris 2024 Olympics on a strong performance by overpowering American neighbors Puerto Rico, 104-83, at the Pierre de Mauroy Stadium in Lille, France.\n\nTeam USA quickly disposed of Puerto Rico with a barrage of three-pointers, fastbreak points, and tenacious defense to go undefeated in their group. Along with the largest point differential out of all teams in the competition, the Americans also secured the top overall seed and assured themselves of facing the worst +/- team in the quarterfinals.\n\nAfter not seeing any playing time at all vs South Sudan, Joel Embiid returned to the starting lineup to score 15 points and block 2 shots. Embiid also had fun trolling the French fans who were constantly booing him all tournament long by shushing the boos when he scored and letting them hear it once Team USA had it going.\n\nAnthony Edwards led the Americans in scoring with 26 points off the bench, and he treated the fans in Paris a huge highlight when he threw down a windmill dunk in the third quarter that left fans out of their seats to appreciate Edwards’ skill.\n\nLeBron James was once again solid in manning Team USA with a solid 10-8-6 stat line while Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, and Anthony Davis each chipped in with 10+ points in Team USA’s 21-point victory.\n\nTeam USA will have two days rest before starting their gold medal run in the knockout rounds when they face Brazil in the quarterfinals.',

        'Serbia overcomes South Sudan to finish 2nd in Group C, book last QF spot',
    body:
        'With just one spot left in the quarterfinals, Serbia and South Sudan played a game down to the wire. In the end, however, it was Serbia who came out on top to beat South Sudan in Group C of the Paris 2024 Olympics, 96-85, at the Pierre de Mauroy Stadium in Lille, France.\n\nAfter Brazil clinched their quarterfinal spot by beating Japan, South Sudan needed a win to book their slot and deny Greece in the process. However, Nikola Jokic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Serbia had other plans in mind.\n\nThe NBA duo of Jokic and Bogdanovic shined when it mattered the most for Serbia. Bogdanovic top-scored for the Serbians with 30 big points, on an efficient 10/14 shooting game, knocking in 6 threes. Jokic had yet another double-double performance with 22 points and 13 rebounds as Serbia shot an absurd 60% from the field.\n\nDespite the loss, South Sudan fought and had plenty to be proud of. They won their first Olympic game in their history and put up strong performances against basketball juggernauts USA and Serbia. The SSD basketball federation has come a long way with its journey led by former NBA player Luol Deng, and this program figures to be ascending to the basketball hierarchy sooner rather than later.\n\nSouth Sudan point guard Carlik Jones gave it his all after playing all 40 minutes, scoring 17 points, dishing out 10 assists, and grabbing 5 rebounds in an all-around effort. Former NBAer Marial Shayok also provided the necessary support for Jones with 17 points, while former Baylor standout Nuni Omot added 14 points.\n\nSouth Sudan made 14-34 threes overall, but Serbia had a huge advantage in free throws, making 21/31 to South Sudan’s just 6 attempts with 5 makes.\n\nUp next for Serbia is a quarterfinal bout with Australia.',
