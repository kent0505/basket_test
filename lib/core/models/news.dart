        'Team USA goes undefeated in pool play after overpowering Puerto Rico',
    body:
        'The USA Men’s National Basketball Team finished off its group stage play at the Paris 2024 Olympics on a strong performance by overpowering American neighbors Puerto Rico, 104-83, at the Pierre de Mauroy Stadium in Lille, France.\n\nTeam USA quickly disposed of Puerto Rico with a barrage of three-pointers, fastbreak points, and tenacious defense to go undefeated in their group. Along with the largest point differential out of all teams in the competition, the Americans also secured the top overall seed and assured themselves of facing the worst +/- team in the quarterfinals.\n\nAfter not seeing any playing time at all vs South Sudan, Joel Embiid returned to the starting lineup to score 15 points and block 2 shots. Embiid also had fun trolling the French fans who were constantly booing him all tournament long by shushing the boos when he scored and letting them hear it once Team USA had it going.\n\nAnthony Edwards led the Americans in scoring with 26 points off the bench, and he treated the fans in Paris a huge highlight when he threw down a windmill dunk in the third quarter that left fans out of their seats to appreciate Edwards’ skill.\n\nLeBron James was once again solid in manning Team USA with a solid 10-8-6 stat line while Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, and Anthony Davis each chipped in with 10+ points in Team USA’s 21-point victory.\n\nTeam USA will have two days rest before starting their gold medal run in the knockout rounds when they face Brazil in the quarterfinals.',

        'Serbia overcomes South Sudan to finish 2nd in Group C, book last QF spot',
    body:
        'With just one spot left in the quarterfinals, Serbia and South Sudan played a game down to the wire. In the end, however, it was Serbia who came out on top to beat South Sudan in Group C of the Paris 2024 Olympics, 96-85, at the Pierre de Mauroy Stadium in Lille, France.\n\nAfter Brazil clinched their quarterfinal spot by beating Japan, South Sudan needed a win to book their slot and deny Greece in the process. However, Nikola Jokic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Serbia had other plans in mind.\n\nThe NBA duo of Jokic and Bogdanovic shined when it mattered the most for Serbia. Bogdanovic top-scored for the Serbians with 30 big points, on an efficient 10/14 shooting game, knocking in 6 threes. Jokic had yet another double-double performance with 22 points and 13 rebounds as Serbia shot an absurd 60% from the field.\n\nDespite the loss, South Sudan fought and had plenty to be proud of. They won their first Olympic game in their history and put up strong performances against basketball juggernauts USA and Serbia. The SSD basketball federation has come a long way with its journey led by former NBA player Luol Deng, and this program figures to be ascending to the basketball hierarchy sooner rather than later.\n\nSouth Sudan point guard Carlik Jones gave it his all after playing all 40 minutes, scoring 17 points, dishing out 10 assists, and grabbing 5 rebounds in an all-around effort. Former NBAer Marial Shayok also provided the necessary support for Jones with 17 points, while former Baylor standout Nuni Omot added 14 points.\n\nSouth Sudan made 14-34 threes overall, but Serbia had a huge advantage in free throws, making 21/31 to South Sudan’s just 6 attempts with 5 makes.\n\nUp next for Serbia is a quarterfinal bout with Australia.',

    title: 'Germany takes down France in heavyweight matchup to claim Group B',
    body:
        'Reigning World Champions Germany showed what they’re made of after beating host team France, 85-71, to take Group B’s top spot at the Paris 2024 Olympics basketball tournament in Lille, France.\n\nGermany showed France why they won the FIBA World Cup last year and became world champions in a masterclass performance. The Germans outplayed the French in virtually every facet of the game, including rebounds, assists, steals, points off turnovers, and points in the paint.\n\nGermany erected a lead as high as 24 points, 57-33, as they poured it on in the third. Rising NBA star Franz Wagner had a huge highlight when he slammed over three French defenders, drawing ohs and ahs from the crowd and his teammates alike. France had no answers to Germany’s attack with point guard Dennis Schroder surgically operating France’s vaunted twin tower defense Victor Wembanyama and Rudy Gobert.\n\nFrance found some life in the 4th quarter behind unsung bench hero Isaia Cordinier scoring 10 huge points, including crowd-hyping dunks and show-stopping hustle plays. The French cut the lead to just 10 points until Schroder and Isaac Bonga settled things down for Germany to take the victory.\n\nWagner and Schroder were incredible for the World Champions, both scoring 26 points to lead the Germans’ attack. Meanwhile, French phenom Wembanyama once again led the team with 14 points and 12 rebounds, however, he had crucial turnovers that led to momentum-shifting plays for Germany.\n\nWith the win, Germany will end up 1st in Group B while France finishes second. Germany will now face Greece in the quarterfinals while France will draw Canada in another heavyweight matchup for the hosts.',

        'Paris 2024 Olympics Day 3: Brazil, Greece, and Canada book QF slots with huge wins',
    body:
        'Three teams have booked their quarterfinal spots in the Paris 2024 Olympics basketball tournament after winning each other’s crucial matches. Here’s how the games went:\n\nBrazil 102, Japan 84\n\nBrazil needed more than 10 points to win coming into the game to qualify for the quarterfinals and they did just that. Behind Bruno Caboclo who played the game of his life, the Brazilians ran Japan off the court to win by 18 points. Caboclo for himself had 33 points and 18 rebounds en route to making history. Vitor Benite and Marcelo Huertas added 19 and 13 points respectively as Brazil now moves on to face undisputed favorites Team USA in the knockout rounds.\n\nGreece 77, Australia 71\n\nGreece upset Australia in this one after losing their first two games to Canada and Spain. After virtually carrying his team for the past two games, Giannis Antetokounmpo had ample help this time as Greece finally claimed a win. Thomas Walkup had 18 points with 4 threes while Dinos Mitoglou had 13 points and 7 rebounds to help the ‘Greek Freak’ who himself had 20 points, 7 rebounds, and 6 assists. This win by Greece complicated Group A’s standings, as Australia, Greece, and Spain all have identical 1-2 records. However, due to superior quotient, Australia and Greece will finish 2nd and 3rd respectively to kick Spain out of the competition. Both teams will now move on to the quarterfinals facing Germany and Serbia respectively.\n\nCanada 88, Spain 85\n\nCanada edged Spain in a close match and ended up taking their opponent’s chance to make the quarterfinals. Spain needed to win by 3 points or more coming to the game to qualify, however, it was Canada who ended up having the margin and taking the win. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was once again brilliant for Canada as he tallied 20 points while Andrew Nembhard provided the necessary support after Jamal Murray struggled once again, scoring 18 points off the bench. Canada will face hosts France in the knockout rounds in a pivotal matchup that may likely decide a medal winner.',

        'Team USA Women’s survived a hard-fought match to earn the win against Belgium, 87-74, and go up 2-0 in pool play at the Paris 2024 Olympics in France.\n\nAfter playing near-dominant and perfect basketball for over 20 years resulting in seven straight gold medals, Team USA got into a near scare against Belgium. This was also the same Belgian team that the Americans barely beat in the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament, if not for a Breanna Stewart putback that gave Team USA the victory.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Brian Windhorst, this was Team USA Women’s 57th straight Olympic win, which has assured them a quarterfinal spot next week.\n\nLas Vegas superstar A’Ja Wilson once again led the Americans with 23 points, 13 rebounds, and 3 steals while partner-in-crime Breanna Stewart had 26 points, 7 rebounds, and 2 assists.\n\nThe Americans will close out the group phase in a showdown vs Germany and stake their claim of the top 2 seeds heading into the knockout rounds.',

    title: 'Team USA goes up 2-0 in Group C after defeating South Sudan',
    body:
        'The USA Men’s National Basketball Team continued to rack up wins in their Olympic journey, this time beating South Sudan, to go up 2-0 in pool play and secure their quarterfinal spot at the Pierre de Mauroy Stadium in Lille, France.\n\nAfter a near scare in their USA Basketball Showcase Game in London where they just won by just a point, Team USA did not let up against this South Sudan team armed with length and shooting. The Americans used every bit of advantage that they have, including all the talent in the world to create separation from the rising South Sudanese. The win essentially made Team USA the top seeded team in Group C with one game to go against Puerto Rico.\n\nThe big storyline of this game however went to the benching of superstar center Joel Embiid, who did not see any minutes at all. When asked post-game what went to the decision, Team USA head coach Steve Kerr iterated the need to match up to South Sudan’s quickness and length on the wings. Kerr started Anthony Davis in this game in place of Embiid then he put Jayson Tatum in the starting lineup after not playing him at all against Serbia. Tatum started the game in place of Jrue Holiday to go along with Steph Curry, Devin Booker, and LeBron James.\n\nThe move went so well as Team USA started off strong with its transition offense as well as an all-switching lineup on defense prevented South Sudan from creating any noteworthy advantages all game long. Team USA also hounded South Sudan’s lead guard Carlik Jones who had a triple-double in the exhibition game they played in London.\n\nBam Adebayo top scored for the Americans with 18 points off the bench while also grabbing 7 rebounds. Kevin Durant, Anthony Edwards, and LeBron James backed him up with 14, 13, and 12 points respectively.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Brian Windhorst, this will not be the last time Steve Kerr is going to change his starting lineup as Team USA will continue to experiment and treat it as matchup-basis in determining the starters. Moreover, Windhorst says Embiid should be back in the starting lineup in Team USA’s last game vs Puerto Rico.',

    title: '2024 NBA Summer League: Day 1 Standouts',
    body:
        'The 2024 NBA Las Vegas Summer League is officially underway with the league’s brightest rookies and young stars put to the test to hone their games and develop their wares to be ready come the official NBA season. Here are some of the players who stood out on the 1st day of action.\n\nAnthony Black and Jett Howard, Orlando Magic\n\nThe duo was the Magic’s first-round picks just a year ago and just in their first game both Black and Howard showed some promising developments that could catapult them into the team’s rotation moving forward.\n\nReed Sheppard, Houston Rockets\n\nThis year’s third overall pick showed out against the Lakers dropping an efficient 23-ball alongside manning the offense for the Rockets. Sheppard looked like he has all the makings of a solid PG in the NBA, which locks in Houston’s core for the foreseeable future alongside young studs Jabari Smith Jr., Amen Thompson, and Cam Whitmore.\n\nDalton Knecht, Los Angeles Lakers\n\nOver three summer league games since the California Classic, Knecht has looked like the Lakers’ best player and continued to do so in Vegas. The 23-year-old shot the ball particularly well and looked confident in taking catch-and-shoot jumpers as well as some on-ball creation at times.\n\nZaccharie Risacher, Atlanta Hawks and Alex Sarr, Washington Wizards\n\nThe top 2 picks in this year’s draft went on a duel with Sarr and the Wizards coming out on top to down Risacher on the Hawks. The French duo both showed great potential on both sides of the floor which explains why they were picked where they were picked in the draft: the talent is clearly there.\n\nJordan Miller, Los Angeles Clippers\n\nThe Clippers’ second-round selection in last year’s draft, Miller went off with a 30-bomb against the Denver Nuggets to lead LA to the win. He went 6-10 from three and 8-8 from the FT line, which was impressive from a player who played mostly in the G-League the past season. With Paul George’s departure, Miller could have a real chance of fighting for a rotation spot if he continues racking up performances like these.',
